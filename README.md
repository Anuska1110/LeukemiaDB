# LeukemiaDB #LeukFit
The model that we proposed for the project was to built a website which has a
user-friendly interface which makes it easy for the user to use it and access the 
information. The sorted gene tables help the viewer to get a clear knowledge 
about the database. Moreover, any researcher is free to add data which saves 
them from the pain of the entire process needed to become an editor of the 
site. Basically, this site is capable of running on its own without anyoneâ€™s 
supervision. The site not only has a database of genes and chromosomes of 
leukemia but it also helps the patients to maintain a record of their health. This 
is done when the patients enter the parameters from their reports on the site 
over time span for instance per month, a graph is formed which gives a visual 
representation of the count of various cell or counts of different parameters 
which also helps to understand how much the treatment is helping.
